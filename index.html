            <b>Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) </b> was the youngest son of
            Debendranath Tagore, a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, which was a new
            religious sect in nineteenth-century Bengal and which attempted a
            revival of the ultimate monistic basis of Hinduism as laid down in
            the Upanishads. He was educated at home; and although at seventeen
            he was sent to England for formal schooling, he did not finish his
            studies there. In his mature years, in addition to his many-sided
            literary activities, he managed the family estates, a project which
            brought him into close touch with common humanity and increased his
            interest in social reforms. He also started an experimental school
            at Shantiniketan where he tried his Upanishadic ideals of education.
            From time to time he participated in the Indian nationalist
            movement, though in his own non-sentimental and visionary way; and
            Gandhi, the political father of modern India, was his devoted
            friend. Tagore was knighted by the ruling British Government in
            1915, but within a few years he resigned the honour as a protest
            against British policies in India.
